# Online Portfolio

This project was just meant to showcase some HTML, Jazascript and CSS editing abilities and then launching the code live into a website so that viewers could see my other projects and experience.

## Deployment

To deploy this project simply go https://zbopp93.github.io/zacbopp-github.io.
Alternativly you can look at the code itself via Github at https://github.com/zbopp93.


## Installation

There isn't anything to install as this is simply a website to show an online resume but if you would like to make edits to the code or use this as your own template I would advise downloading the contents from github into a new folder that you save in your own pc files. You can then use an application such as Visual Studio Code to open the folder you just saved onto your pc. Visual Studio(or whatever application you prefer) will then launch the code and you'll be able to make edits and changes as you please.
